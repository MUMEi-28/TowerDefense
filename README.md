# 🛡️ TowerDefense Prototype

**TowerDefense Prototype** is a commissioned Unity project showcasing a functional prototype of a classic tower defense game. It features strategic tower placement, enemy pathing, and automated combat — designed to demonstrate core mechanics for future expansion.

## 🎮 Game Overview

In this prototype, players defend against waves of enemies by strategically placing towers on designated grid boxes. Each tower automatically targets and attacks enemies within range. Enemies follow a defined path toward the base, and your goal is to stop them before they reach the end.

## 🏗️ Core Features

- 🧠 **Pathfinding AI** – Enemies follow a fixed path to simulate wave-based invasions  
- 🏰 **4 Unique Tower Types** – Each with distinct visuals and stats  
- 🎯 **Auto Targeting System** – Towers shoot at enemies within range automatically  
- 🟦 **Grid-Based Placement** – Towers can only be placed in valid box areas  
- 🌀 **Prototype-Ready System** – Modular setup, easy to expand and customize
